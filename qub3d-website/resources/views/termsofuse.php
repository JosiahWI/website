			<h3>Terms of Use</h3>
            Tell you what, we hate these things too. We've tried to make it as simple as possible, and are always looking for simpler alternatives. Thank you for reading the legalese below.

            <h4>1. Terms</h4>
            By accessing the websites at http://qub3d.org or any of its subdomains, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing these sites. The materials contained in these websites are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

            <h4>2. Use License</h4>
            The following license is in effect for all materials (information or software) on Qub³d Engine Group's websites which do not have another explicitly-stated license.

            Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Qub³d Engine Group's websites for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

            modify or copy the materials;
            use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
            attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Qub³d Engine Group's website;
            remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
            transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.
            This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Qub³d Engine Group at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

            <h4>3. Disclaimer</h4>
            The materials on Qub³d Engine Group's websites are provided on an 'as is' basis. Qub³d Engine Group makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

            Further, Qub³d Engine Group does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

            <h4>4. Limitations</h4>
            In no event shall Qub³d Engine Group or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Qub³d Engine Group's websites, even if Qub³d Engine Group or a Qub³d Engine Group authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

            <h4>5. Accuracy of materials</h4>
            The materials appearing on Qub³d Engine Group's websites could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Qub³d Engine Group does not warrant that any of the materials on its websites are accurate, complete, or current. Qub³d Engine Group may make changes to the materials contained on its websites at any time without notice. However Qub³d Engine Group does not make any commitment to update the materials.

            <h4>6. Links</h4>
            Qub³d Engine Group has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its websites and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked sites. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Qub³d Engine Group of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.

            <h4>7. Modifications</h4>
            Qub³d Engine Group may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.

            <h4>8. Governing Law</h4>
            These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Iowa and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.

            If any provision of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
